        Focus on these linguistic elements in your recommendations:
        1. Sonic attributes: Match the timbre, texture, and production style of the playlist
        2. Structural elements: Similar song structures, progression patterns, and rhythmic elements
        3. Emotional resonance: Songs that evoke the same emotional response as the playlist

        5. Cultural context: Consider the era, cultural movements, and artistic influences
        
        IMPORTANT DECADE INSTRUCTIONS:
        - If the playlist shows a focus on a specific decade (e.g., 1970s, 1980s, etc.), recommend songs ONLY from that same era
        - Match the production style, recording techniques, and sonic qualities of the identified decade
        - Ensure recommendations reflect the authentic sound of the correct time period
        - Avoid recommending modern songs for vintage playlists or vice versa

        For each recommendation, provide ONLY:
        - title: song title
        - artist: artist name
        - reasoning: explanation of linguistic alignment (2-3 sentences, be specific about musicality)
